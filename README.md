# About this repository:
A C#(.NET) Unity program that simulates 3D physics from a first-person perspective. Users can navigate and interact with the 3D environment. 

# How to use this simulator:
Use the WASD keys to move in all cardinal directions and the spacebar to ascend. Letting go of the spacebar will let you descend. 
Look around with the mouse and left-click to interact with the environment by firing a ball in the direction you are looking at.

# What's the purpose of this simulator, anyway?
It was originally intended to be a clone of the video game Doom, but after working on it for a while, it became more of an exercise of Unity's physics engine and its capabilities. 
I'll experiment with this program even more as I work on it, maybe even adding functionality to stick to walls, slipping on certain floors, or even creating sticky ceilings to attach the user to.
